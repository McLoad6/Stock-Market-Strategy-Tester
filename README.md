# Stock-Market-Strategy-Tester

This program will be build up from the following tools:

# 1. CSV file cleaner
   *Which will check that all rows are available (missing time period)
   
     *Auto filling if few row are missing
     
     *Coparison with other CSV for missing period (maybe a higher timescale)
     
   *Modification of uncertain values (like 10% price change in 1-5 minute)
   
# 2. Definition of basic chart reading (type of candels, trends)
# 3. Calculation of potential strategy:
   *opening rules (buy/sell when something happen e.g. after 2 green candel 1 red candel apear)
   
   *closing rules
   
   *results saved in CSV
